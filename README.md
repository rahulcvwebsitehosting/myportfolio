# Rahul S - Engineering & Web Development Portfolio

A professional engineering-focused landing page and project showcase designed to demonstrate the intersection of civil engineering logic and full-stack software development.

## Description

This application serves as a comprehensive digital hub for technical project demonstrations, academic records, and professional leadership roles. It is designed for recruiters, collaborators, and clients to explore a portfolio of work that ranges from climate-tech industrial twins to high-performance augmented reality experiences. The project solves the problem of presenting complex, multi-disciplinary engineering data in a clean, accessible, and high-performance web interface.

## Features

*   Interactive Project Showcase: A structured grid featuring technical problem/impact analysis for specialized engineering projects.
*   Automated Profile Agent: An integrated intelligent response system that handles professional inquiries and provides context-aware information about project details.
*   Performance-First UI: A bespoke, high-contrast user interface optimized for industrial aesthetics, accessibility, and smooth interaction.
*   Academic & Engagement Tracking: Live visualization of academic performance metrics (CGPA) and a log of technical symposium presentations across various engineering colleges.
*   Bespoke Animation Engine: Utilizing low-latency motion libraries to provide intuitive visual feedback and smooth navigation without compromising browser performance.

## Tech Stack

*   Frontend Framework: React 19
*   Programming Language: TypeScript
*   Styling: Tailwind CSS
*   Motion & Animation: Framer Motion
*   Build Tool: Vite
*   Intelligence Layer: Large Language Model (LLM) integration for real-time automated interactions
*   Icons: Lucide React

## Installation & Setup

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rahulshyam2006/rahul-portfolio.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd rahul-portfolio
    ```

3.  Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  Configure environment variables:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and provide the necessary credentials.
    ```env
    API_KEY=your_access_key_here
    ```

5.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## Usage

Users interact with the application through a smooth-scroll single-page interface. The project grid allows for deep-diving into specific case studies, while the navigation system provides quick access to academic records and technical skills. The sidebar response agent can be used to query the author’s background, project stack details, or contact information through a standard chat interface.

## Future Improvements

*   Server-Side Rendering (SSR) migration: Transitioning to Next.js for enhanced SEO and initial load performance.
*   Headless CMS Integration: Implementing a backend for dynamic project updates and blog posts.
*   Advanced WebGL Visuals: Adding custom 3D shaders for interactive engineering model previews.
*   Localized Support: Implementing multi-language support for international engineering collaborations.
